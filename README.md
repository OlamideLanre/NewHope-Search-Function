# NewHope-Search-Function
NewHope University, a prestigigefous institution dedicated to fostering academic excellence and innovation. The university currently maintains an academic database that stores information about its esteemed academic staff members, including their personal details, educational qualifications, employment history etc

Current System Statement:
The current academic staff database at NewHope University lacks efficient search capabilities and suffers from performance issues when handling large datasets. The existing system relies on basic SQL queries without the utilization of indexes or full-text search functionality. The absence of appropriate indexes and full-text search functionality hinders the system's ability to provide quick and accurate search results.

Envisioned System Statement:
The envisioned system aims to optimize the university's academic staff database by implementing indexes and full-text search functionality. This enhancement will significantly improve the search capabilities, increase the system's performance, and provide a more efficient way of retrieving relevant information from the database.
Appropriate indexes will be created to speed up search operations, and to enable more comprehensive and efficient searches, full-text search functionality will be integrated into the system. This feature will allow users to perform complex searches based on specific keywords, phrases, or even proximity of terms within academic staff profiles. Full-text indexes will be created on relevant columns to enable efficient text-based searches.

NOTE: This was a group project, This project also has a gui but heres the query version. Microsoft SQL Server was the engine used in this project It can be ran on other SQL engines too.
To see changes in the execution plan I/O cost more values should be inserted into the table(s) with indexes
